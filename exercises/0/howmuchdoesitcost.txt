For these exercises, look up the credit cost for your snowflake edition, cloud provider and region for your snowflake account.

  a) You have a simple workload that runs daily in Snowflake. The workload uses 0.5 credits per day. Calculate the total credit usage and cost for a 30-day month.
    15 credits.

  b) Your workload varies throughout the month. For the first 10 days, you use 2 credits per day. 
  For the next 10 days, you use 1.5 credits per day, and for the last 10 days, you use 1 credit per day. 
  Calculate the total credit usage and cost for a 30-day month.
    20 + 15 + 10 = 45
    45 credits.

  c) You have three different warehouses running workloads simultaneously. 
  Warehouse A is of size XS, Warehouse B is of size S, and Warehouse C is of size M. 
  Warehouse A is used for 10h/day, B is used for 2h/day and C is used for 1h/day. 
  Calculate the total monthly cost assuming each warehouse runs for the full 30-day month.

Warehouse A: 10 per day
Warehouse B: 4 per day
Warehouse C: 4 per day

A + B + C = 18
18 * 30 = 240 + 300 = 540
540 credits

  d) Your Snowflake warehouse uses auto-scaling. 
  For the first 10 days, it operates on 2 clusters for 10 hours per day. 
  For the next 10 days, it scales up to 3 clusters for 10 hours per day. 
  For the last 10 days, it scales up to 4 clusters for 10 hours per day. 
  Calculate the total monthly budget. 
  Assume the warehouse consumes 1 credit per hour per cluster.

First 10 days = 20 * 10 = 200 total
Days 11-20 = 30 * 10 = 300 total
Days 21-30 = 40 * 10 = 400 total

Monthly cost = 900 credits.
